## Verilog
==========

#### What for

Behavioral descriptions => logic-circuit structures

#### Module

- Basic unit in Verilog, containing:
— declarations
    — names and types of inputs and outputs
    — local signals, variables, constants and functions only valid inside the module
    — values could only be passed between modules by i/o
— statements
    — specify operations of the module internally
    — behavior: such as assigning values to signals based on conditions
    — structural: initialize more modules and define their interconnections
— modules behave hierarchically
